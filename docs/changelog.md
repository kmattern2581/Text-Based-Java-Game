## To Implement

- Recreate same-type damage boost for weapons in a better way — For each tag in common between weapons, add damage boost (maybe a 0.2x multiplier)
- Revamp Monster Creation System with HashMaps per floor; pass them into monster creation function via array of maps/sets
- Add Monster Strengths & Weaknesses
- Add Rogue set where it translates agility to strength and increases crit maybe. Should be cool and have a new set
- New Stuff on each types of rooms
- Enchantments that you can use on an Item to add buffs or special tags. *Be Careful When Overriding Tags its static right now*
- - This will allow for interesting interactions with chests or other rooms.
- Breakable wall that you can only bust down with strength to get rewards
- three pronged room that you get to choose your next room.
- write a toString for the items
- possibly make it so items can be in multiple sets at once - display might get messed up when doing the item info menu.
- add description to all items *IN PROGRESS*
- RE-REFACTOR SHOP CLASS - Its kind of gross right now 
- Make it so some monsters carry herbs + other ways to get herbs
- Blacksmithing :
  - Improve weapons + Armor
  - Rename weapons

## TO FIX URGENTLY

- Make bosses a little weaker or randomize them less
- FIX CTHULU HES VERY BROKEN
- - possible print statement bug?
- - Honestly idk whats going on everything is awful

## Monster Balancing Calculation

Currently Set to A random level based on player level and World Level and then individual stats based on that.
STR is too high they die in like 2 hits
Boss armor is also too high
